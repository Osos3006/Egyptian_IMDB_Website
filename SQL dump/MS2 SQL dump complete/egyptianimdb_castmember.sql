1974 in Washington, D.C. and raised in Cairo. After getting a bachelor\'s degree, she attended Harvard where she studied visual arts and philosophy. Her directorial debut was the Arabic film “Mokattam” named after the famous mountain of Cairo where a garbage collecting and recycling village lies. In association with D.A. Penneabaker, she made “Startup.com,” a film that tells the story of the dot com phenomenon and its eventual end by following Noujaim\'s classmate at Harvard, Kaleil Tuzman as he establishes \'govworks\' with his high school friend Tom Herman. Two weeks before the Iraq war, Noujaim gained access to both Al Jazeera and the US military\'s central offices in Qatar. She caught the onset and outbreak of the Iraq war on film. The result of this experience was the movie “Control Room,” an attempt to tell the story of how information is gathered, edited and eventually recreated by those who present it. In 2006, she won TED Prize for her talk about her “wish to bring the world together for one day a year through the power of film.” Noujaim actually realized this wish in 2008, when millions gathered around the world to watch Pangea Day, a 4-hour program of short films with inspirational talks and global music connecting people from Cairo, London, Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro and elsewhere. Noujaim bore witness to the 2011 revolution in Egypt, which would be the subject of her next documentary \"The Square\" or \"Al Midan,\" released in 2013. It follows six individuals, all of whom are young revolutionaries in Tahrir, from the euphoria of Mubarak\'s step down to the uncertainty of the transitional period under military rule.','17 May
